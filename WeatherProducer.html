    <h1>Fun Day!</h1>
    <p>My day is great (kinda) this happened during winter vacation it didn’t snow until 30 december so we shovel the snow in the driveway then my neighbor came and we play together then we made forts then we shovel all the snow in the street. In tuesday there was a snowstorm so we played in the snow and we shovel the driveway. Then we continued playing we started to making a mountain but it didn’t look well so we just made fort we went to my neighbor’s yard then we made another fort I made a hole ( Well meant to be a mini home). My sister came and help me and things went right. Because my sister is there for my fort. And this is a fun day!</p>
